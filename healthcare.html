REVIEW FEEDBACK:
Strengths:
+ Well-researched healthcare content
+ Good use of academic citations
+ Clean article structure and layout

Critical Issues:
- Branding mismatch: Uses "Healthcare" instead of "Cats" branding
- Different Bootstrap version from other pages (5.3.3)
- Navigation styling differs from index page
- Missing author information

Suggestions:
- Align branding with main site theme
- Standardize Bootstrap version
- Add author credits

                        <p class="card-text">Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become one of the most transformative
                            applications of computing in healthcare. AI systems can process and analyze vast amounts of
                            medical data such as X-rays, MRI scans, and lab reports—faster and often more accurately
                            than human doctors. Machine learning algorithms detect early signs of diseases such as
                            cancer, diabetes, and heart conditions, helping clinicians make quicker and more reliable
                            diagnoses. For example, research by Al-Waeli and Abdul Hameed (2024) found that AI tools
                            improved diagnostic precision and reduced medical errors by analyzing complex imaging data
                            effectively (Wasit Journal for Pure Sciences
                            ). Similarly, Hirosawa and Shimizu (2025) reported that AI-powered systems improve workflow
                            efficiency and personalize treatment recommendations by combining different patient data
                            sources (Computers, Materials & Continua
                            ).</p>

                        <p class="card-text"> Telemedicine uses computing and communication technologies to deliver
                            healthcare remotely. Through video consultations, mobile apps, and digital monitoring
                            devices, patients can connect with doctors regardless of physical distance. This has proven
                            vital for people in rural and underserved regions, who may lack access to hospitals or
                            specialists. A 2024 study published in Frontiers in Healthcare Technology found that
                            telemedicine significantly improved healthcare accessibility and reduced travel costs for
                            rural patients (Frontiers in Healthcare Technology
                            ). Likewise, a PubMed study (2024) showed that telemedicine programs in rural China enhanced
                            healthcare satisfaction and access, allowing doctors to monitor chronic conditions more
                            effectively (PubMed Article). Computing makes these systems possible through reliable
                            internet platforms, secure data storage, and real-time communication technologies..</p>

                        <p class="card-text"> Computing also supports patients with disabilities and chronic illnesses
                            through assistive technologies. Tools such as voice-controlled devices, AI-driven
                            prosthetics, smart wheelchairs, and wearable sensors enable individuals to live more
                            independently. These technologies are particularly important for monitoring vital signs and
                            alerting caregivers in emergencies. Philips (2021) discussed how healthcare digitalization,
                            supported by computing, contributes to better patient experiences and sustainability by
                            reducing unnecessary hospital visits and improving energy efficiency (Philips Blog).
                            Assistive computing enhances the quality of life for patients while making healthcare more
                            inclusive and responsive to diverse needs..</p>
